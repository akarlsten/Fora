# A forum platform

This is the repo for my untitled forum platform, similiar to Reddit but with threads and posts sorted chronologically.

## Documentation

All documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://gitlab.lnu.se/1dv430/student/ak222ye/project/-/wikis/home).

Project backlog is in the form of a [Kanban board](https://gitlab.lnu.se/1dv430/student/ak222ye/project/-/boards).
